Advance Wars Edit - Currently holds the "in-development" version of the project. Most up-to-date stuff so if you want to contribute or play around with it (and see what's in store for the future), this is your folder.

Advance Wars Engine v0.1b - The official release of the project to the public. Somewhat stable, has a few obvious bugs.
<p>
OLD Advance Wars XP - Back when I didn't really plan on making a modifiable engine for the public. This holds a simple build of the game that would become the framework for my project. Would have originally been my first demo released to the public.
